# The Gemini Character Sheet
The character sheet contains everything you need to play the game and includes 2 modes of operation: view and 
edit.  To switch between view and edit modes simply check the box labeled "Edit" in the top right of the 
character sheet to enter edit mode or uncheck to return to view mode.

***Insert Screenshot of the edit checkbox here***

Let's discuss each mode of operation in their own sections.

## View Mode
Viewing mode allows you to actually play the game by rolling dice via the built in dice rollers (more below) or 
by clicking on an Attribute of Skill.  You will also have tooltips which will appear when mousing over character
sheet items such as Attribute and Skill names.  

Players are able to swap back and forth between viewing and editing their character sheet at any time by checking 
the "Edit" button.

### Dice Rolling
There's a few different ways you can access the dice roller while in view mode.  We explore the options available
to you for rolling dice below.

#### Attributes & Skills
Clicking on an Attribute will roll the die code and return the results to you in the chat pane of Roll20.  You 
should see something similar to the following screenshot in your chat pane:
